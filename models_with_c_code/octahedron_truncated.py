r"""

This model provides the form factor, $P(q)$, for a general octahedron.
It can be a regular octahedron shape with all edges of the same length.
Or a general shape with different elongations along the three perpendicular two-fold axes.  
It includes the possibility to add an adjustable square truncation at all the six vertices.
This model includes the general cuboctahedron shape for the maximum value of truncation.
The form factor expression is obtained by analytical integration over the volume of the shape.
This model is constructed in a similar way as the rectangular prism model.
It contains both the form factor for a fixed orientation and the 1D form factor after orientation average.

Definition
----------

The general octahedron is defined by its dimensions along its three perpendicular two-fold axis along x, y and z directions.
length_a, length_b and length_c are the distances from the center of the general octahedron to its 6 vertices.

Coordinates of the six vertices are :
    (length_a,0,0)
    (-length_a,0,0)
    (0,length_b,0)
    (0,-length_b,0)
    (0,0,length_c)
    (0,0,-length_c)

t is the truncation parameter. 
Truncation adds a square facet for each vertice that is perpendicular to a 2-fold axis.
The resulting shape is made of 6 squares and 8 hexagons, that may be non regular depending on the three distances.
A square facet crosses the x,y,z directions at distances equal to t*length_a, t*length_b and t*length_c.

A regular octahedron corresponds to:
    length_a = length_b = length_c
    t=1

A regular cuboctahedron shape with 6 squares and 8 triangles corresponds to :
    length_a = length_b = length_c
    t=1/2

The model contains 4 parameters: length_a, the two ratios b2a_ratio and c2a_ratio and t :
    b2a_ratio = length_b/length_a
    c2a_ratio = length_c/length_a
    1/2 < t < 1

For a regular shape :
    b2a_ratio = c2a_ratio = 1

Volume of the general shape including truncation is :
V = (4/3) * length_a * (length_a*b2a_ratio) * (length_a*c2a_ratio)*(1-3(1-t)^3)

The general octahedron is made of eight triangular faces.
The three lengths A_edge, B_edge and C_edge of their edges are equal to :
    A_edge^2 = length_a^2+length_b^2
    B_edge^2 = length_a^2+length_c^2
    C_edge^2 = length_b^2+length_c^2

For a regular shape :
    b2a_ratio = c2a_ratio = 1
    A_edge = B_edge = C_edge = length_a*sqrt(2)
    length_a = length_b = length_c = A_edge/sqrt(2)
    V = (4/3) * length_a^3 = (sqrt(2)/3) * A_edge^3  * (1-3(1-t)^3)

Amplitude of the form factor AP for the fixed orientation of the shape reads :
    AP = 6./(1.-3(1.-t)*(1.-t)*(1.-t))*(AA+BB+CC);

    with:

    AA = 1./(2*(qy*qy-qz*qz)*(qy*qy-qx*qx))*((qy-qx)*sin(qy*(1.-t)-qx*t)+(qy+qx)*sin(qy*(1.-t)+qx*t))+
                                1./(2*(qz*qz-qx*qx)*(qz*qz-qy*qy))*((qz-qx)*sin(qz*(1.-t)-qx*t)+(qz+qx)*sin(qz*(1.-t)+qx*t));

            BB = 1./(2*(qz*qz-qx*qx)*(qz*qz-qy*qy))*((qz-qy)*sin(qz*(1.-t)-qy*t)+(qz+qy)*sin(qz*(1.-t)+qy*t))+
                                1./(2*(qx*qx-qy*qy)*(qx*qx-qz*qz))*((qx-qy)*sin(qx*(1.-t)-qy*t)+(qx+qy)*sin(qx*(1.-t)+qy*t));

            CC = 1./(2*(qx*qx-qy*qy)*(qx*qx-qz*qz))*((qx-qz)*sin(qx*(1.-t)-qz*t)+(qx+qz)*sin(qx*(1.-t)+qz*t))+
                                1./(2*(qy*qy-qz*qz)*(qy*qy-qx*qx))*((qy-qz)*sin(qy*(1.-t)-qz*t)+(qy+qz)*sin(qy*(1.-t)+qz*t));

    and :
            Qx = q * sin_theta * cos_phi;
    	    Qy = q * sin_theta * sin_phi
    	    Qz = q * cos_theta
    	    qx = Qx * length_a
    	    qy = Qy * length_b
    	    qz = Qz * length_c

$\theta$ is the angle between the scattering vector and the $z$ axis of the octahedron ($length_c$).
$\phi$ is the angle between the scattering vector (lying in the $xy$ plane) and the $x$ axis ($length_a$).

The normalized form factor in 1D is obtained after averaging over all possible
orientations and this part is implemented in the same way as in the rectangular prism model.

.. math::
    P(q) =  \frac{2}{\pi} \int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \,
    \int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}} A_P^2(q) \, \sin\theta \, d\theta \, d\phi

And the 1D scattering intensity is calculated as

.. math::
    I(q) = \text{scale} \times V \times (\rho_\text{p} -
    \rho_\text{solvent})^2 \times P(q)

where $V$ is the volume of the truncated octahedron, $\rho_\text{p}$
is the scattering length inside the volume, $\rho_\text{solvent}$
is the scattering length of the solvent, and (if the data are in absolute
units) *scale* represents the volume fraction (which is unitless).

For 2d data the orientation of the particle is required, described using
angles $\theta$, $\phi$ and $\Psi$ as in the diagrams below, for further details
of the calculation and angular dispersions see :ref:`orientation` .
The angle $\Psi$ is the rotational angle around the long *C* axis. For example,
$\Psi = 0$ when the *B* axis is parallel to the *x*-axis of the detector.

For 2d, constraints must be applied during fitting to ensure that the inequality
$A < B < C$ is not violated, and hence the correct definition of angles is preserved. The calculation will not report an error,
but the results may be not correct.

    Note that rotation $\theta$, initially in the $xz$ plane, is carried out first, then
    rotation $\phi$ about the $z$ axis, finally rotation $\Psi$ is now around the axis of the cylinder.
    The neutron or X-ray beam is along the $z$ axis.
